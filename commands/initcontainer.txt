In a multi-container pod, each container is expected to run a process that stays alive as long as the POD's lifecycle.
For example in the multi-container pod that we talked about earlier that has a web application and logging agent, both the containers are expected to stay alive at all times. The process running in the log agent container is expected to stay alive as long as the web application is running. If any of them fails, the POD restarts.



But at times you may want to run a process that runs to completion in a container.
For example a process that pulls a code or binary from a repository that will be used by the main web application.
That is a task that will be run only  one time when the pod is first created. 
Or a process that waits  for an external service or database to be up before the actual application starts. 
That's where initContainers comes in.
