<=======================Backup and restore of cluster=======================>
kubectl logs etcd-controlplane -n kube-system | grep -i version


root@controlplane:~# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://[127.0.0.1]:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \

Snapshot saved at /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db
root@controlplane:~# 

Use the etcdctl snapshot save command.
 You will have to make use of additional flags to connect to the ETCD server.
--endpoints: Optional Flag, points to the address where ETCD is running (127.0.0.1:2379)
--cacert: Mandatory Flag (Absolute Path to the CA certificate file)
--cert: Mandatory Flag (Absolute Path to the Server certificate file)
--key:Mandatory Flag (Absolute Path to the Key file)


<==================To restore the etcd=====================>

root@controlplane:~# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup \
snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db


2021-03-25 23:52:59.608547 I | mvcc: restore compact to 6466
2021-03-25 23:52:59.621400 I | etcdserver/membership: added member 8e9e05c52164694d [http://localhost:2380] to cluster cdf818194e3a8c32
root@controlplane:~# 


Note: In this case, we are restoring the snapshot to a different directory but in the same server where we took the backup (the controlplane node) As a result, the only required option for the restore command is the --data-dir.


Next, update the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml:

We have now restored the etcd snapshot to a new path on the controlplane - /var/lib/etcd-from-backup, so, the only change to be made in the YAML file, is to change the hostPath for the volume called etcd-data from old directory (/var/lib/etcd) to the new directory /var/lib/etcd-from-backup.

  volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
    name: etcd-data
With this change, /var/lib/etcd on the container points to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup on the controlplane (which is what we want)

When this file is updated, the ETCD pod is automatically re-created as this is a static pod placed under the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.

Note: as the ETCD pod has changed it will automatically restart, and also kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler. Wait 1-2 to mins for this pods to restart. You can run a watch "docker ps | grep etcd" command to see when the ETCD pod is restarted.

Note2: If the etcd pod is not getting Ready 1/1, then restart it by kubectl delete pod -n kube-system etcd-controlplane and wait 1 minute.

Note3: This is the simplest way to make sure that ETCD uses the restored data after the ETCD pod is recreated. You don't have to change anything else.

If you do change --data-dir to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup in the YAML file, make sure that the volumeMounts for etcd-data is updated as well, with the mountPath pointing to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup (THIS COMPLETE STEP IS OPTIONAL AND NEED NOT BE DONE FOR COMPLETING THE RESTORE)
