<===========remove node for maintenance=================>

kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets

<================make node availablbe after pacthing=========>
kubectl uncordon node01

only when new pods are created it will be scheduled on this pod.

it will not allow you take down the node for maintenance if you have any pod running on node without replicaset
as it may result in loss of  pod and it will not be created on other node.

<=============marking node as unschedulable for new pods==============>
Do not drain node01, instead use the <<<kubectl cordon node01>>> command. 
This will ensure that no new pods are scheduled on this node .
The existing pods will not be affected by this operation.
