<===========remove node for maintenance=================>

kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets

<================make node availablbe after pacthing=========>
kubectl uncordon node01

only when new pods are created it will be scheduled on this pod.

it will not allow you take down the node for maintenance if you have any pod running on node without replicaset
as it may result in loss of  pod and it will not be created on other node.

<=============marking node as unschedulable for new pods==============>
Do not drain node01, instead use the <<<kubectl cordon node01>>> command. 
This will ensure that no new pods are scheduled on this node .
The existing pods will not be affected by this operation.

<==============upgrade plan ==============>
kubeadm upgrade plan
then check for stable version 
we plan to upgrade the master first so, drain the master

On the controlplane node, run the command run the following commands:

apt update
This will update the package lists from the software repository.

apt install kubeadm=1.20.0-00
This will install the kubeadm version 1.20

kubeadm upgrade apply v1.20.0
This will upgrade kubernetes controlplane. Note that this can take a few minutes.

apt install kubelet=1.20.0-00 This will update the kubelet with the version 1.20.

You may need to restart kubelet after it has been upgraded.
Run: systemctl restart kubelet
